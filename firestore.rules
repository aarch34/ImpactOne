/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and bookings.
 *  Venues and Buses are publically accessible. Only the admin (admin.impact@iceas.ac.in) can approve or reject the bookings.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the owner.
 *  - /venues/{venueId}: Stores venue data, publicly readable.
 *  - /buses/{busId}: Stores bus data, publicly readable.
 *  - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking requests, accessible only to the owner and admin.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 *  - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *  - Venues and Buses are publically readable.
 *  - Only the admin can approve or reject the bookings.
 *  - Bookings are owned by the user who created them.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *  - The 'Booking' entity contains a 'requesterId' field that must match the user's path parameter to enforce ownership.
 * @structuralSegregation
 *  - Private user data (profiles) is stored under the /users/{userId} path.
 *  - Bookings are stored under the top-level /bookings collection.
